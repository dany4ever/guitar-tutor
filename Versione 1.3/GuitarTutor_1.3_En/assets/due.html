<h2> Sound </h2> 
<p> 
The sound is an acoustic phenomenon that is the generation of a vibration of an elastic body, which generate waves that reach our 
ear, usually through the air. 
A sound can be defined, the frequency <b> </b>, the number of vibrations per second. The sound of "LA" center corresponds to a number 
of waves per second was 440. The frequency then determines the pitch, in fact we can define the following feature: 
<ul> 
<li> The sound is sharper, the more the number of vibrations is most pronounced </li> 
<li> The sound is more serious if the number is less vibration. </li> 
</Ul> 
<br/> 
L '<b> intensity </b> identifies the amplitude of vibration, and determining the volume, according to this rule: 
<ul> 
How <li> greater the amplitude, the higher the volume. </li> 
</Ul> 
<br/>

<br/> 
<b> Stamp </b> features of each sound depends on the number and intensity of individual harmonics generated by the sound 
essential and therefore the shape of the wave. 
<br/> 
The sound is then the basis for making music with any kind of musical instrument, it being understood that the generated music is pleasant. 
The term comes from a pleasant acoustic fenomino called "<b> beats </b>"; these beats are made by sound waves 
generated, which overlap so inperfetto. 
From the concept of beats comes to <b> consonance </b> and <b> dissonance </b>, in fact: 
are said to be dissonant sounds that produce beats between them. <br/> 
The use of dissonant sounds is sometimes used to give more complexity to the melody.
