<h2> Notes </h2>
<p>
Before getting in the section on jazz improvisation, it is necessary to introduce some key concepts fundamental
to correct instrumental studies, ie <br/> <b> "notes and their representation" </b>. <br/>
For musical note means basically two things:
</P>
<ul>
<li> sign with which you are the sounds used in music </li>
<li> same sound generated by a single instrument or voice. </li>
</Ul>
<p>
<br/>
In writing system traditionally used for European classical music of the past four centuries, the notes are written
empty or filled circles, with and without various types of other specific signs that are placed on the staff.
<br/>
The notes have a frequency of multiples compared to the other are similar: the range given by these notes is that <b> eighth </b>.
Therefore, they are commonly called with the same name. Therefore, to uniquely identify a note should also indicate
Membership of the eighth. <br/> The musical notes of the diatonic scale are seven: <br/>

<h2> Representation </h2>
<p>
Every single note you can determine both the height and duration, and how that is expressed through the precise figures given below:
<br/>
<div>
<a href="images/note.png"> <img width="300px" height="150px" src="images/note.png" /> </a>
</Div>
<br/>
In addition to these figures, there are other less frequently used, such as:
</P>
<ul>
<li> <b> Short </b>: Two whole; </li>
<li> <b> Semibiscroma </b>: 1 / 64; </li>
<li> <b> Fusa </b>: 1 / 128 </li>
</Ul>
<br/>
<p>
In addition to the representation with the figures above, there are other figures such as:
</P>
<ul>
<li> <b> simple point </b>: Increases the duration of the preceding figure of 1 / 2 </li>
<li> <b> Point Double </b>: Increases the duration of the figure that precedes it, the 3 / 4; </li>
<li> <b> Triple point </b>: Increases the duration of the preceding figure of 7 / 8; </li>
</Ul>
