<h2>Jazz</h2> 
<p id="content_paragraph">
Jazz is a genre of origin 
American born in the early twentieth century in the African American community 
southern United States from the confluence of African musical traditions and 
Europe. 
Distinguishing features of this kind are 
intensive use of improvisation, often syncopated swing rhythm and tone 
melancholy (as the use of blue notes). 
Jazz music is a folk music born out 
diverse cultures and peoples, which has expanded from America to Europe, up to 
reach the global spread. 
Jazz music is a discipline and total 
complex, based on improvisation, impromptu expression of its 
and the subconscious self, which melt. 
In Jazz, as in any field of music, 
the expression of improvisation, coincides with the attainment of nothingness and 
completely and this is developed by creating melodies 
new and instantly developed while 
the artist plays.
