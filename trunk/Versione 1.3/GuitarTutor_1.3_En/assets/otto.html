<h2> Chords Structure and Use</h2>
<br/>
<p>
A Chord is the composition of three or more notes played simultaneously.
The basic composition of an agreement is that of three notes and is called "<b> Triad </b>".
We can divide the agreements in four major categories:
<ul>
<li> <b> Major chords </b> </li>
<li> <b> Minor chords </b> </li>
<li> <b> Seventh chords </b> </li>
<li> <b> Semi-diminished chords </b> </li>
</Ul>
<br/>
<h4> Major chords </h4>
Major chords are characterized by the following structure: <br/>
<ul>
<li> 1st degree (Major) </li>
<li> 3rd degree (Major) </li>
<li> 5th degree (Flat) </li>
</Ul>
<br/>
<h4> Minor chords </h4>
The minor chords are characterized by the following structure: <br/>
<ul>
<li> 1st Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 3rd Degree (Minor) </li>
<li> 5 degrees (Flat) </li>
</Ul>
<br/>

<br/>
These categories are extracted from the main course of triads (major and minor).
In this triad, we can add a further degree (the 7th grade on a scale), achieving
so an agreement of 7 °. <br/>
Chords of 7 degrees are used in blues and jazz and are
the backbone of these genres. <br/>
Here's the chord structure in which we added the 7th grade. <br/><br/>

<h4> Seventh chords </h4>
Seventh chords are divided further into three categories: <br/>
<ul>
<li> <b> Seventh major </b> </li>
<li> <b> Minor seventh </b> </li>
<li> <b> Dominant seventh </b> </li>
</Ul>
<br/>
<h4> Major seventh chords </h4>
<ul>
<li> 1st Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 3rd Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 5th Degrees (Flat) </li>
<li> 7th Degree (Major) </li>
</Ul>
<br/>

<h4> Minor seventh chords </h4>
<ul>
<li> 1st Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 3rd Degree (Minor) </li>
<li> 5th Degrees(Right) </li>
<li> 7th Degree (Minor) </li>
</Ul>
<br/>

<h4> Dominant seventh chords </h4>
<ul>
<li> 1st Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 3rd Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 5th Degree(Flat) </li>
<li> 7th Degree(Minor) </li>
</Ul>
<br/>

<h4> Semi-diminished chords </h4>
<ul>
<li> 1st Degree (Major) </li>
<li> 3rd Degree (Minor) </li>
<li> 5th Degree (Diminished) </li>
<li> 7th Degree (Minor) </li>
</Ul>
<br/> <br/>

We can also extend this rule to successive degrees to 7 degrees, resulting in chords of 9 °, 10 °, 11 ° 13 ° and 16 °. <br/>
This rule is necessary for the construction of so-called "<b>tetrads</b>".
<br/> In the next section, we report the chord structures of tetrads (up to 7 degree) on the different positions of the handle <br/>
