<h2> Improvisation </h2>
<br/>
<p id="content_paragraph">
Improvisation is to compose a musical line staff, from melodic or harmonic material pre-existing. <br/>
There are several ways to improvise, which generally depend on the specific musical genre that we are adopting.
In this teaching we will mainly improvisation blues\jazz, using the definitions introduced in the method. <br/>
<br7>
Improvisation Blues, but that goes for the Jazz, is to use the pentatonic scales and modal pattern, alternating
They vary in tone of the piece. <br/>
The main rule to improvise are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Identify the tone 'of the piece; </li>
<li> Decide which scales to use to run the improvisation </li>
<li> Outline the structure of the melody in a way that creates a circular riff that you can repeat in the piece. </li>
</Ul>
<br/>
<br/>
Based on the above, the most delicate is the identification by ear the piece, and choosing the right scale to use. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<h4> Improvisation on the pentatonic scale </h4>
Improvisation on the pentatonic scale fingering is to choose as the starting scale according to the following rule:

<ul>
<li>Choose the tonic note on a single string and apply the pattern required (see the CAGED system); </li>
<li>Move bettween the patterns vertically and horizontally to generate dynamicity;</li>
</Ul>
<br/>
<br/>

<h4> Improvisation on modal scales </h4>
The improvisations on modal scales, in contrast to the use of pentatonic scales, is to adopt the fingering of the scale,
appropriately, in accordance with the Agreement specifically performed at the moment when you want to improvised piece. <br/>
This mode 'is more' complex and requires a lot more 'ear and precision in terms of technical/rhythmic.
<br/>
For example, in the case of a piece in shades '<b> C Major </b>, you can' use the scale (major) Ionian DO, jointly with the
first fingering of the pentatonic scales.
Similarly, if the piece change of tone '(eg a bridge), you can' use the scale (minor) Eolia in LA, in conjunction with the fifth
fingering of the pentatonic scales. <br/>
To familiarize yourself improvisation you should see the section devoted to technical exercises.
